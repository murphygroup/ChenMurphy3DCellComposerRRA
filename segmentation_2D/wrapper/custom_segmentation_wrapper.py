	Custom Segmentation Method.

	This function is intended to be filled in by the user with their custom method for 2D cell segmentation.

	Parameters:
	nucleus (3D array): nuclear channel input for segmentation.
	cytoplasm (3D array): cytoplasmic channel input for segmentation.
	membrane (3D array): cell membrane channel input for segmentation.
	axis (str): The axis along which the 2D segmentation is performed.
	
	Returns:
	cell_mask_axis (3D array): a stack of 2D cell segmentations through input axis.
	nuclear_mask_axis (3D array): a stack of 2D nuclear segmentations through input axis.
